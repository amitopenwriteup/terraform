The `terraform fmt` command is used to automatically format your Terraform configuration files. 
It helps ensure consistent formatting and improves code readability. When you run `terraform fmt`,
 it scans the specified files or the entire directory and applies the Terraform formatting rules to reformat the code.

Here's how to use `terraform fmt`:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing your Terraform configuration files.

2. Run the following command to format all the files in the current directory:

   ```shell
   terraform fmt
   ```

   If you want to format a specific file, provide the file path instead:

   ```shell
   terraform fmt path/to/file.tf
   ```

3. `terraform fmt` will apply the formatting rules to the specified file(s) and overwrite them with the formatted version.

The formatting rules enforced by `terraform fmt` include:

- Indentation: The command adjusts the indentation levels to match the Terraform best practices, typically using two spaces per indentation level.
- Alignment: It aligns equal symbols (`=`) in blocks and aligns resource blocks vertically.
- Sorting: The command sorts resource blocks, variable blocks, and other sections alphabetically to improve consistency.

Using `terraform fmt` is recommended as part of your Terraform development workflow to maintain consistent and clean code style across your configuration files. 
It helps make your code more readable and minimizes the chances of formatting-related issues when collaborating with others or performing code reviews.
